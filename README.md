# hello-world

My first repository 

I'm an Architect (the old-skool sort that designs buildings) with an interest in web development and the logic of coding.
I'm married with two small children so learning to code on the side is a bit slow-going.
That said, I'm currently taking CS50 - Intro to CompSci from Harvard via edx.org and I learn/practice coding every day on SoloLearn.
